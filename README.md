# RefWeak
A list of weak Bacterial assemblies in GenBank. Avoid using these references in your analysis.

## Why does this exist?
Mistakes happen and poor quality data makes it into GenBank. This can waste lots of your time to track down 
and the purpose of this list is so that you can share what you've found, so that others can avoid your mistakes.

## How do I tell you about a new genome?
Submit an [issue](https://github.com/refweak/refweak/issues) and let us know.  We need to know the GenBank accession number, species and why theres a problem with the reference.

## Why would someone deliberately submit a poor quality assembly?
A published study may have used mapped data in their analysis, rather than de novo assembly.  
For the sake of completeness and openness the researchers then submit all assemblies in their study, even if they are lower quality.  Poor quality assemblies still contain useful information.

## Does it include draft assemblies?
Yes. These are the most problematic.

## How do I appeal a decision?
Update your genome and resubmit it to GenBank, or withdraw the assembly, then let us know.
